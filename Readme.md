ECMAScript is a JavaScript standard intended to ensure the interoperability of web pages across different browsers.It is standardized by Ecma International in the document ECMA-262.
ECMAScript is commonly used for client-side scripting on the World Wide Web, and it is increasingly being used for writing server-side applications and services using Node.js and other frameworks.


Arrow function — also called fat arrow function— is a new feature introduced in ES6 that is a more concise syntax for writing function expressions. While both regular JavaScript functions and arrow functions work in a similar manner.
// ES5
var add = function(x, y) {
  return x + y;
};
// ES6
let add = (x, y) => { return x + y };
